    "This program is a <I>financial simulation</I>: it calculates total student debt and the term and monthly payments on that debt, post-graduation. Debt calculations are based on USM estimated expenses for tuition, books, fees and supplies and for room and board (https://usm.maine.edu/student-financial-services/estimated-cost-attendance-one-year). Only one loan program is considered: the Federal William D. Ford Direct PLUS Loan program (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus). This program is for parents and graduate students. It was chosen for this assignment because the other available federal loan programs (Subsidized/Unsubsidized) have limits on the size of the loan, per semester. All expense estimates and program rules are correct as of fall 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment assumes that you graduate in four years and don't attend school or work over the summer -- and that you take the summer after graduation off. No provision is made for estimating the impact of debt reduction through other sources of support (work, savings, parent contributions, scholarships, etc.). No provision is made for estimating additional debt (cost of commuting, meals, summer and winter programs, etc.).  Please note that <u>this assignment should not be used as a substitute for a certified payment calculator</u>.\n",

    "Note: this is a long, complex and demanding program. Take it one step at a time, and congratulate yourself when you get it done!"
